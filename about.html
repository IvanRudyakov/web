    <h1>About Us</h1>
    <p>Cyclomatic Extension is our little corner of the internet where math and physics meet humor. We're a couple of lifelong learners who believe that education shines brightest when it's delivered with a smile. Our goal is to show how much fun problem solving can be when you let your personality shine through every calculation.</p>
    <p>With each video we produce, we aim to teach real concepts while sprinkling in jokes, goofy skits, and the occasional dramatic reenactment of a physics problem. It's all about making complex ideas accessible and giving you a reason to laugh along the way.</p>
    <p>Between us we have experience tutoring, performing improv, and building robots that only occasionally malfunction. Those experiences shape the lessons we create.</p>
    <p>If you're curious about where the Cyclomatic name came from, it was inspired by our shared love of software engineering metrics and the wild ride of fluid mechanics.</p>
