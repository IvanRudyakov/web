# Cyclomatic Extension Website

This repository contains the Cyclomatic Extension website, a static site prepared for an academic assignment. It demonstrates how mathematics and physics can be presented with a light touch of humor. The project consists of simple HTML pages for an introduction, background information, sample videos, and inspirational quotes.

## How to view the site

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to access the homepage.
3. Each page loads its own JavaScript file for animations.
4. The homepage now contains two small widgets: one that solves quadratic
   equations and another that uses the Pythagorean theorem. Make sure
   JavaScript is enabled to try them out.
